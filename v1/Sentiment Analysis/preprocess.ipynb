Even though you said you didn't take too much inspiration from the Greek Gods I can't help feel a reference to them. Like the warlord of the sea and salt (Neptune) and a God that lives under the bodies of the dead (Hades).  It's a very interesting first look at the book.

      "\"Hiya!  I'm a big reader of high fantasy and some of the inspirations you listed for this story are some of my favorite books so I thought to check this out! Being honest  I really like the lore you've established here (just ask my friends  I'm a sucker for mythology!) And from reading this  it really shows that you've put alot into this world and how all these gods  goddesses and Houses fit into it all. You also really used text alignment to your advantage and I think it really fit the tone you were trying to convey. However  I have to say while the writing itself was fine  the overall feel of this opening felt...clunky.   \"\"This is the story Queen who no longer feared death..of a King who helped her laugh again....\"\" (I'm paraphrasing here  please bear with me.)  It's alot of telling versus showing and then you have a huge shift in tone. Almost like you went from pitching the story to the readers to going to some scene where X character is hearing stories around a campfire. It's a pretty sharp contrast and it doesn't go very well together in my opinion. I think you'd really benefit from getting rid of \"\"This is the story of a queen\"\" bit and just leaving this prologue as the conversation between the unknown characters about the world and the gods and goddesses who inhabit it.  So overall  I'm not super sold on this prolouge as it is  but your lore is so detailed that I think I'm going to move on and see what happens next.

First of all  I love how your loved ones  specifically your mom inspired you to write. That is like the sweetest thing I've ever heard of. Second  the proologues are typically the boring part of the story but this one stole my heart in a million ways. The characters seem unique and awesome and I can't wait for them to develop into the likeable heroes or villains they will become later on in the future. The little story about the origins of the fantasy world were both intriguing and fascinating to read! I already got a sense of what I'm going to be reading when I start! I will continue reading this and I'm sure it will not disappoint! â™¡â™¡â™¡\"                                                 \n",

      "I like this chapter a lot more than I liked the prolouge. The overall tone of this chapter was way more consistent and read a lot more smoothly as a result. I really liked the eerie atmosphere you created with the blood ritual; it definitely felt taboo and creepy (and I say that in the best way possible!) And though I don't know the name of this character who was narrating  whoever she was  I think she was established very well. Her tone struck me as very petulant  wanting something she wasn't fit to have and insisting she was owed it  even after she had been denied because some things just can't happen.  I'm definitely getting the idea that she might become a villain in this story after this failed encounter with the shade and the denied wish.   That aside however  I do have a note regarding the writing of this chapter. At times \" your prose became a bit too purple (another way to say it got overly descriptive) and really took away from what this could've been.  I saw this most at the opening here:  \"\"The clock struck twelve\"  the planets shifted \" the stars exchanged...my blue eyes were hazy...\"\" Your word choice for this section was nicely varied and certainly descriptive\" \" but it was a lot of description in a really short amount of time. I think cutting some of it out would help focus on the chapter on the main event (the interaction with the shade) alot more and really throw the reader in head first.  For example: \"\"The clock struck twelve and I watched as wisps of coal black smoke curled around my hands as the knives slit my wrists. Blood splattered onto the mirror in front of me\" \" the candles began to dim as I counted back from thirteen....\"\"  I'd hope you'd have better word choice than I did in the above\"  but I hope my point comes across either way. We're getting right into the ritual then  rather than taking our time.  Also  last thing  at the end you have single sentences as full paragraphs \" \"\"This was not supposed to happen\"  I had to run \" the corridor was empty...\"\"\"                                \n",

      " #OnlyVoraciousReader  Wonderful!  Superb!  The ending hook was done nicely and will keep the readers hooked and waiting for the next chapter.  It's a very well-written chapter  with good characterization. You have perfected the trick of writing chapters by writing well-sized chapters as most of the wattpaders are usually scrolling on their phones.   They prefer short chapters of 1500-2000 words.   Keep it short and sweet.   Well written.   Your description was well done and it makes the reader feel like he is actually experiencing the story.   Usually  authors choke the readers with too much information  but you are writing perfectly and giving the info gradually.   Excellent opener  though. Very hooking. A well-written chapter  with good characterization  I did not spot any grammar mistakes  but in case I did not spot them  I would recommend using a grammar-checker like Grammarly to smooth out the wrinkles.   It is a good thing that you did not use a lot of A/N in the first chapter  it deters people off from the topic. You have used the Ch1 well  most people misuse the Ch1 or simply do not know how to use it well. they give too much or too less info in one stroke.   I liked the way you end the chapter  it leaves the reader hungry for more.  Thank You.  Regards  OnlyVoraciousReader                                     \n",

I've been studying for exams and have been tight on schedule:(   I really don't know why I didn't like the organization of this chapter. It was messy when it came to the dialogues in this chapter. I feel like it would have been much better if you added a new paragraph for another dialogue for example:  \"\"Don't do that! \"\"  \"\"Why not? \"\"  This is so that it's easier for readers to read the chapter without getting confused. I did however like the poem at the beginning but it didn't capture much of my attention and this is me speaking from a person who likes reading poems.

The emotion of the shade seemed really real  as well as that of the narrator. Somehow I don't know who this is  but I know her aims and ambitions. That is a really cool way to characterize. Even though I understand that the italics are meant to stress some thoughts  there were a bit too much of those. Like the ending with the italic was perfect.

My only criticism  or perhaps pet peeve  would be the spacing for some of the dialogue. For me  particularly further down  it's too bunched up and looks like it's one person talking  especially with the lack of tags in the dialogue. So that's maybe something to be looked at later on.

      " #BelieverBC  Overall the chapter was  well written. However I did have some issues with it  and I'll explain the the best that I can. First  as a prologue  it feels more like a chapter one. A prologue should be shorter  so I would reconsider the titling of this piece. Second  you use a lot of suddenly  and thens in the narrative. The problem with using words like And then  or suddenly  is that it takes away from the immediacy of the scene. We are taken away from the story by thinking of the word suddenly \" so it becomes something that kind of weakens the narrative. In dialogue I can see it working. We say \"\"all of a sudden\"\" a lot\"  so keep that in mind too.   I also feel that there is too much about the main character and the shade. Like I feel that there's being too much thrown in a prologue. I really feel like if you want to worldbuild Endollon  you should focus on the Regnants in the following chapter and leave world building out of the prologue (if you decide to keep it as a prologue). Prologues should be teasers  and I feel that there is just too much info in this. I know I said that already  but it's something that I think could be worked on for this prologue.    Now what I liked a lot was the way you handled most of the descriptions. Nothing was lacking in meat  and the voice was pretty strong all the way through  so I compliment that and your ability to continue writing with precise lines. There was the line I loved the most and it was the dialogue with the shade. For some reason I felt the shade being raspy voiced  and when I read that it had a raspy voice  I wondered why I felt like that. I noticed that the shade needs more description of raspy stuff  but I feel like thatmight have been why since it's shadowy and almost ghost like.   Overall this is an enjoyable read  even if it was a little heavy on the detail for a prologue.                              \n",

      "@rubyruins #GraphicPrice This is a very interesting chapter and Edna is an interesting character. I was surprised to see this chapter has a modern setting. The pace and description are good but I did have a bit of a peeve with some of the story. 💢  When Edna was talking about her wealth  upbringing (and etc) it became repetitive and way stretched-out in some areas. Like where she lives  her brand begs  she donates  has a very very very very very very big important business.💣💥  Speaking of Edna  she seems like she's a Mary Sue a little. She came from an unknown past and with a little bit of help in the right direction  she became a rich woman who donates a lot of money to the less fortunate and has an amazing behaviour and manners. Then it gets better👠💄💎💍 . . .  She's going to be a Queen. 👸👑   The fact she's dying doesn't overshadow she's an over-achiever who seems not to be dying anytime soon now.😕  I love the storyline and theme so far though.💖                                          \n",

And as for babbling/disappearing  I have one word: magic. Same thing for how the people got into her penthouse.  And the talk of the future queen means basically that Edna is destined for greatness which is great because Edna is great. I love her character. She seems honest and strong. Plus  I'm interested in seeing how she develops.  On another note: I thought it was cool how you started the story off in New York. It was a nice addition especially since most books of this ilk (i.e. Three Dark Crowns  A Song of Ice and Fire  The Crown  etc.) start off in the high-fantasy world of who knows where.   Not that there's anything wrong with that  of course. It just adds to the whole feeling I'm getting from this book.   A nice cool breath of fresh air. A brilliant breath of fresh air.

I'm a bit surprised to see someone doing their research on actual facts and knowledge. There are very few authors that would think twice before putting a chapter out in public without getting everything confirmed first. I commend you on that!   I believe there were quite a number of questions that could easily just be placed in one or two dialogues rather than separating them because it not only takes up a lot of space but it makes the story quite draggy if there were too many dialogues.

When it's being read on a computer screen  it's quite hard to read through the whole thing  particularly as there is a lack of dialogue tags. It makes it impossible to distinguish who is saying what. I would suggest separating it out more so that it is easy on the reader's eyes.  Also  the information dump is a little bit of an issue. We find out a lot about the character and it is hard to process it all and remember every little detail. You could try filtering all this information throughout the book rather than just unloading it as has been done here. That way it'll be easier to read and process everything.

      " #believerbc   There's a tiny problem...you need to put who's talking in your dialogue because I kinda got confused for a second. You have an amazing plot that's for sure. But what im noticing here on Wattpad is that the famous books have crappy grammar but the people don't care because the book has a good plot.   I love modern fantasy. I even have a series of books that im writing that has modern fantasy. You left us with a cliffhanger and I love those. Sometimes it can get a bit of irritating but that's what brings the readers back to your story!                                                \n",
      "\n",
      "I got confused with the dialogues in the first part  especially when they were squabbling and all. I think you need to clearly define who is talking. But other than that  I can see that you put a lot of effort in this! Yes  I've already read the prologue (it was fantastic btw. Very original. How do you kill a God? I will always remember this. A God for a God. Geez  I'm already getting goosebumps from that) and also your author's note (inspirational!) Okay so we have Edna  a modern Manhattan City elite genius and philantropist suddenly clashing with people who don't seem to be from the same world  what with their weird long names and titles. Okay so my theory that this was the start of her afterlife is debunked. Sad. Anyways  I'm just...lol cos here she is...literally dying of heart failure and these people are bantering right in front of her. And I think it's pretty obvious that she's having problems with her health/heart with her gasping and struggling so she shouldn't be surprised that Eric knows about her condition. Okay now another theory. Eric may be a potential lover to Edna right? Haha. Or am I wrong. But anyways  the ending is appropriate with a cliffhanger cos now we know that Edna's condition is actually 'made' and the only reason it's still working despite the ventricle practically dangling in the open is because she's....connected to the Gods/is a God? And that there is a cure... and somehow  I don't know if it's intended or how you manage to do it  but I imagine the new characters to have a British accent? Lol. Btw  the chapters are just nice in length so it's easy to read. Nice work!   #believerbc                                     \n",

      " #believerbc  I have a few issues with this chapter  but most. of them are very small. I love the story  your concept is amazing. Your characters are vibrant and interesting. But some of my problems fall in the wording of things. Sometimes dialogue seemed a bit awkward. Like when she said get out of my penthouse  it seems like she would probably say house or home.  Also  the fact that she gives him ten minutes seemed strange to me. I would not give anyone that time. I also got confused on how she's so shocked to have the guy know it was her heart. If your heart hurt  you'd probably show it by curling in on your chest. To somebody that saw  It'd be like a 50/50 chance between heart and lungs.   I love the story so far  though. It mixes some aspects of mythology with modern fantasy in a way that is really smooth. Keep up the good work. <3.                                         \n",

And about the family in general.   Fortunately\"  It's not that hard to grasp the basic content about the lord of the sky and mother earth - having six children  and their two children -Cosmo and Titania - eventually becoming the rulers when the fall.  But  maybe it would be a good idea to draw a family tree   including ones for the different houses and show how they are linked together- so that the readers could look back on it in order to get a clearer understanding of the characters and the story.  It would be so much easier to get a snapshot view of it- if we ever do need a reference.   Sorry for the super long comment. I hope that I made sense when I typed this all in.

      "@Tophie_Star  Wow  you really do know her quite well  I feel so glad!😇 Well  you are absolutely right. Edwina is her own person  and she's used to power because she's actually had nothing in the start and she built it up herself - let me clarify with a bit of backstory here?   When Asteria died  well  Elodie too had died. Edwina's father  Lucius was Lord of Dracnesse but he was sentenced to fifty years of imprisonment. Both her parents gone. At the same time  Aidon had his Trials. Which left just Edwina and very small baby  Amphitrite  whom she had no idea how to raise. Oh  and she had half a huge river to defend  along with the combined strength of the really pissed off Valmonts and the greedy Everlys who wanted her part of the Derwent. That was one of the most trying times of her life  and those ghosts never left her. At all.  That's the reason why she feels very  very personal about her family. It's because she's known what it feels to live without them  and she knows how much precious your loved ones can be. Cosmo knew that fully well  and it forced him to threaten her. Because more or less  yes  Edwina is her own person  and she hates it when someone tells her what to do. She lives on her terms. She's seen injustice for too long  especially with the females  always considered the weaker sex in their world. So she tries harder and harder to fight  and it's one of the biggest lost wars of her life when she finally agrees to marry Tristan. Because it bends her to three men's will - her father  Cosmo  and Tristan himself. Besides  as a wife  she'd now have to move from Dracnesse and stay in Tristan's Castle in Stormholt.   And that is the same place where her mother's killer resides too.                      \n",

Hope they don't bite their throats off on their wedding though.   Great chapter Ellis....                                              \n",

My first three chapters got so much crap the first time I tried my hand in this writing my own work  someone in a bookclub went as far as downright saying she does not like the chapter at all and kept inlining every single flaw. Of course I delete them because that type of negative energy I do not need. Then another set of people were like I should do this and that you know what I did? I took all those crappy opinions and wore them like a freaking armor  I took a few deep breaths and rant to a few good friends. I believed in my story and I just said f*ck it! Went back and improved my chapters that was up and continued to write and today that same crappy book is a multi time award winner! It started out being featured in top 20s  then I reedited and we started winning third places  went back and reedited and we moved to second place! And I believe so much in my story and felt it can do better  I started rewriting that shit. It's been a rough road to where we are now but the challenges made us where we are now. So my advice! Take deep breaths and rant out all your emotions  then go back to the drawing broad with a big f*ck it and WRITE if you believe in your characters WRITE!

Every time someone critiqued my works and saying that it's absolute rubbish  it would always get to my head. I now know that you really shouldn't take it to heart and just plough through it but back then  I didn't. I would start doubting my novels and would eventually delete my account and make another account to post a new  better story.

      "Aw honey  I haven't read it yet  but I think your book seems awesome! It's great that you're trying to break cliches \" and the \"\"keeping the readers afraid of the mc\"\" part is not only a good way to hook your readers\"  it's actually different from other books! Only a few books keep you genuinely worried about the characters (ASOIAF)  but in most of them  you're sure they're gonna come out victorious.  I totally get that thing about being down because of a review. I got one for my story Up  Up and Away once and even though most of it was still in a positive light  the negative parts hit me HARD. They were things I had never stopped to consider. Although I was (and still am) thankful to the reviewer  I began to question why on earth I was even bothering to write in the first place. I began to think that I was the worst writer on the face of the planet  and I was writing the most cringeworthy book of all time. What I decided from that was to not ask for my book to be properly reviewed until after I completed it. That way  I wouldn't break down half-way through and sit in mourning for the death of my confidence. But after a while  most (not all  I guess) of the insecurity wore off  and I felt more confident about writing. And the encouragement of my friends really helped too. If your readers think your work is good  if they like it  then that does half the trick!   Although it's important to actually like what you write  I think it's also natural for you to question parts of your book. Being blind to your own flaws can't possibly be of any help  so it's a good thing if you know where you're going wrong! That way  you can improve. (And not become full of yourself by thinking you've written the best book in the whole wide world.)   As your friend  all my support is with you. I hope you will be able to see your book in good light again soon. ❤️❤️❤️❤️                            \n",

      "This comment may be offensive. You know I love this book. It's wonderful it really is  the writing is well done and it's clear that you've thought the story out and have a direction that this is all going in but ; I don't think any of these scenes with the royalty have been properly thought out. Edwina is Queen regnant no matter if they like her or not  no matter if they want money or into her pants her word is law. The fact that these same people can continue to disrespect her  harass her and try to kill her MULTIPLE times WITHOUT punishment is completely unacceptable and amazing to me that NO ONE does anything about this! You could argue that she broke his hand or whatever just happened but that is not what the punishment should be for someone trying to kill THE QUEEN in her own home. These people should be locked away or tied to a rock so their insides can be pecked out by birds for eternity but they should not be given warning after warning without anything being done. Same with Tristan. The scene where he rescues the young girls is insane! A man should NOT be able to WHIP THE KING ACROSS THE FACE and continue breathing! By even disobeying direct orders from him should equal some kind of punishment if not death equal to death. I'm sorry if this seems rude but every time I read about these people calling their QUEEN wench or harlot or trying to kill her AGAIN it just takes me out of the story. I can't imagine that they just let these horrific people continue on with their wicked lives as if they had half as much power as Tristan and Edwina do. I don't know what kind of monarchy these people are running but it clearly isn't effective.                                             \n",

      "Hello there! Since you've expressed the desire of improving  so I've read this far and now I'm ready to give you a first opinion. You already know what I think of the introduction chapter  so I will focus more on the following two. The plot per se is very unique  so is the world you created and its system. I found the Monarch Trials interesting and the magic the gods wield certainly have potential. Having said that  I'm not sure I'm going to continue your story - here's why. The writing style had appropriate diction and proper grammar  however  I personally found it meagre  almost like a script  with plenty of well-constructed dialogue but no real narrative. Perhaps it was because of the need to explain a lot of stuff (I'lll come back to that)  but to me it felt fast and rushed. It caused  therefore  a lot of confusion in my head  specially with the character  which I wasn't able to identify. Expect for Edna  since it's her point of view  I have only blurry ideas of the other characters mentioned. They are reduced to their names  while I don't have an idea of how they look like  how they act  and what their personality is like. Your way of explaining background is clear and neat  however  I felt that it was definitely too much  to the point I personally don't have a real input to jump and read the next chapter. In many ways  it also felt obvious. I expected she was going to be a god  and that they'd put her on Earth for her protection. Again  the world you created and its players have tons of potential  which I envy  but they are not expressed to their fullest  thus  sounding to me both chaotic and simplistic. Last but not least  in terms of emotions  I personally didn't feel attached to Edna  in particular to her resistance to drink the medicine and come back to her real world. Mostly  it was because I didn't perceive the fifteen years she mentions  didn't feel the attachment she had to her life  despite the first chapter (which  if I may say  kind of (continues)             \n",

      "Try to use less adverbs during dialogue tags. Keep them simple (i.e. he said  she said) so that the action flows. Especially during an information bomb  it's best not to get too caught up on something as benign as a few little words. Otherwise it's great 👍 😊  The one part eating me alive was her heart condition. If it was as bad as the doctors said it was  she wouldn't be allowed to do any strenuous activity. So the prolonged scene in the second chapter where everyone is arguing and Edna has a gun is really stretching it. She would have had problems throughout the whole scene. When the first guy (blondie I believe  lol) appears out of nowhere  that would have given her an awful start.   Plus  holding a gun with the intent to shoot would skyrocket a heart rate. Not sure how much shooting experience you've had  but a gun is a very explosive weapon. A lot can go wrong  especially at such close range. Even if she's been trained to use it  that doesn't change the fight or flight response she would be having in the moment. The movies make it seem like nothing to fire away  but that's far from the reality.  ~ I really loved the opening line. I've done a script with that same first part spoken by Edna  and it really brought a lot back for me to read that. Probably not what you were going for  but I thought I'd share  cause it stuck with me through all 3 chapters. The rest of the dialogue was also quite good  might I say.

It started when she first saw the Titaness. Ever since then  strange things have been happening. I think that it's because of their presence. Because the only person who knows that they're there is Edwina  so they have everyone turn against her.   Aidon is affected. In the previous chapters  we see how he is with Edwina; he loves her. This isn't how he'd act..   Her sister  Amphitrie  is affected. Llewellyn was affected. Eric. Basically everyone  with the exception of the Rotavelles  because they were always *sshats.   Aidon isn't the one who wants the Cube; the Titans do. It's a whole ploy  to get it and destroy all the gods/goddesses. And they started it  by turning them all on their Queen. They made her feel like an outcast  a murderer.  Plus  she's the only one of them who can figure out how to open the Cube. I refuse to believe that they're all acting like assholes  because she killed the triplets.   Everyone knows Edwina by now and her love for Amphitrite  so they could've easily put down that bullsh*t.

The characters  the world building and the development is outlined and written so flawlessly that I couldn't help but physically&emotionally 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭 these emotions and I can see them as real living souls who got lost in a dark  twisting  vicious storm that you have created. I loved Edwina's bravery and sense of unbelievable power and her need to put others before her own. I love Tristan's dynamic personality and that he loves Edwina but he barely tells her that in person. The descriptions are thought-out brilliantly and I could imagine that I was there  𝘷𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘭𝘺.

      "God. I'm so sad to see this book over honestly. For months I had been going through some stuff and finally decided to get Wattpad again. I'll never forget the day I was looking through the tags Fantasy and found this piece of treasure. I put it in my library  just knowing I had to keep it there and read it. The moment I started to read it  I was completely hooked. Throughout the chapters you made me laugh  cry  (well almost. I was out in public so held back during most chapters) and made me want to write something like this. But unfortunately  as you know I quit writing. But you made me realize how much I miss and loved writing. Also  at the end of all the chapters I remembered that life doesn't all give us a happy ending.   When I say it's hard for me to read sometimes  it definitely is. Sometimes if I'm not interested enough my mind wanders  and I don't really focus on the story. But this  of course I did. From start to finish   . So I want to thank you. Thank you so much for creating this beautiful work of Art. Thank you for giving me inspiration when I least expected it  and thank you for giving me hope and strength when it was most needed. Edwina taught me a lot  but if anything she taught me to be strong and fight  because a Queen NEVER goes down without a fight.                                     \n",

You start understanding and knowing what to write about.  Oh yeah... THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MANY CHARACTERS. And if it gets confusing I'm fine with it. Attack On Titan  my personal favorite anime/manga has a crap ton of characters and half of the time I'm like: Dafaq is going on? Why is he the Colossal Titan...? I mean I've seen how fucking tall he is... but he was a sweet  hot guy! How could he be one of humanity's destroyers?!  Buts that's just my thoughts. And if I enjoy this I will read the entire story  even when I'm not in your group.                                             \n",

The motivations  the thoughts  the ideals that each character holds close to them make them so distinct  such an individual entity  that it shocked me. The pain that I felt when Tristan died was shocking. The silent sobbing was shocking. The sheer force of your words nearly bowled me over. Hours and hours  I have spent pouring over your work. You point out the flaws  but I want to bring to light the beautiful strengths that it has. The words themselves work alongside you. The imagery is stronger than a Robert Frost poem.

Despite those flaws  this book is still incredible. Its still a wonder of neatly tied up plot threads and terrifying villains who kill hundreds with a snap. Its a spectacle of bloody poetry that grabs the reader and doesn't let go. I know I certainly couldn't let go.

I don't remember ever getting it back  but I did get into the English Lit class which was apparently very selective  so there you go. So for all of this  two years of intrigue  plot twists and that damn slow burn  I can safely say  from the bottom of my heart  thank you so  so much.                                \n",

You captured this world so beautifully and the characters so fluently that every time I click open a new chapter I feel like I am the characters or standing right beside them in some corporal form. You have created a masterpiece that deserves to be hung  in the Louvre.                                                \n",

To me she was a promiscuous and wanted woman that was scorned by the one she wanted most and she was so obsessed with getting him back for that  that she became blind sighted by the embarrassment and anger. I think the more angrier she got  the sloppier she got and that was her ultimate downfall                                               \n",

You really are a writer and Crown of Glass is nothing but a master piece. I'm so proud of all of this  the words you pulled together to make such amazingly beautiful chapters.
